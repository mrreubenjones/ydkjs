**Summary:** Simpson puts together a great coding primer for the unintiated. I
like how he gets the reader to immediately start coding in the browser console.
It's a refreshing change from the code-in-page or IDE approach that a lot of
online schools are taking.

Chapter 1: Into Programming

Right away, we're talking about console.logs, alerts and prompts, proper commenting, 
and the various values and types needed for the basic program. A good refresher 
and solid foundation for the up and coming JS onslaught. ;)
